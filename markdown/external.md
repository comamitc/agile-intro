## The Manifesto

- ** Individuals and interactions ** over processes and tools
- ** Working software ** over comprehensive documentation
- ** Customer collaboration ** over contract negotiation
- ** Responding to change ** over following a plan

## Key Principles of Agile

- The best architectures, requirements, and designs
emerge from self-organizing teams
- At regular intervals, the team reflects on how
to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts
its behavior accordingly
- Continuous attention to technical excellence
and good design enhances agility
- Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount
of work not done -- is essential.

## Sprint Planning (Estimation)

- Estimations are wrong! <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->
- In Scrum, estimations are recorded as story points <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2" -->
- Story points follow fibinocci sequence (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13) <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="3" -->
- Velocity is measured by story points per sprint <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="4" -->
- Last sprint's summed story points "done" are this sprint's max capacity <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="5" -->

## Definition of Done

- Definition of Done is a simple list of activities that add verifiable/demonstrable value to the product
- Not only in terms of functionality but also in terms of quality

And because teams are self organizing... <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="1" -->

__* They agree to what this list contains *__ <!-- .element: class="fragment fade-in" data-fragment-index="2" -->
